## Getting started

In this repository, you will be creating to separate projects in two separate folders:

- `express-api`: This will be a simple API that will be used to create, read, update, and delete data, first from a flat file, then from a relational database, then from a NoSQL database.
- `remix-app`: This will be a Remix application that will be used to consume the API and display the data.
